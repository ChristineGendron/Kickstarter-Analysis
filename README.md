# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Analyzing Kickstarter data to uncover trends, focusing on theater in the US and UK

### Purpose

Using Excel to determine whether there are specific factors that make a Kickstarter campaign more likely to succeed, in order to advise someone planning on fundraising to produce a play.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

This dataset contained a lot of information that didn't directly pertain to what we needed to analyze for the client. I struggled a bit with constantly going back and forth between my tables and the main sheet to pull out the specific pieces I needed. This included struggling to pull data using the VLOOKUP formula for the first time.

## Results

Analysis

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

As you can see in the above chart, some months produce more successful campaigns than others. Our client may want to launch in May or June when success rates are historically high. She may want to avoid the winter months.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Campaigns with modest goals have the most consistent rates of success. It might be best for our client to set a fundraising goal of $5,000 or less. Campaigns with high goals (45,000 and above) are very likely to fail.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

A major determining factor in the success of a Kickstarter campaign is visibility. The more that buzz is generated around a campaign, the more likely it is to succeed. It could have been started by an influencer, picked up by a media outlet, heavily shared within a supportive community, et cetera. We are also not able to use this data to look at external circumstances that would cause certain times of the year to have more success than others. (You can see this manifest in the table that highlights Edinburgh plays. Four of the five featured plays are associated with a particular event, the Fringe Festival). The only metric that touches on this factor within our data set is "Staff Pick".

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We could use the Staff Pick data to help control somewhat for visibility in the success rates. In the likely scenario that our client's campaign is not a Kickstarter staff pick, does that affect her best course of action?
